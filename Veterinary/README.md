•	In addition, some reporting functionality is required such as the number/types of animals seen by each vet, the amount of income generated over a given time, and the number of pets staying overnight etc (manager would like to get as much useful information from the system as possible and is therefore open to the inclusion of any other useful reports). 


2.	The following functionalities should be provided for the vet interface:
•	Enter the diagnosis and prognosis of each pet seen.
•	View the status of pets kept overnight (see Boarding Staff section below).
